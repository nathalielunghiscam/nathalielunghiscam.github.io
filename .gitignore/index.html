  <p>A lady, supposedly Nathalie Lunghi has approached multiple people around the UK asking for money as her bank card has been frozen. She says she will pay the money back and to contact her via Instagram or Facebook, however she doesn't reply. If you still want to give her money that's up to you, but please be aware of this history.</p>
  <p>If the genuine Nathalie Lunghi wants this page taken down all we ask is that she post a photo on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nathalielunghi/?hl=en">@nathalielunghi</a> warning people about this scam.</p>
